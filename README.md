Finding word analogies using word2vec

#### word2vec is an algorithm that transforms words into vectors, so that words with similar meaning end up laying close to each other. Moreover, it allows us to use vector arithmetics to work with analogies, for example the famous king - man + woman = queen.

#### Word2vec creates vectors that are distributed numerical representations of word features, features such as the context of individual words. It does so without human intervention. Given enough data, usage and contexts, Word2vec can make highly accurate guesses about a word's meaning based on past appearances.
